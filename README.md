Roodle
======

An old school project I did years ago, when I was first learning how to implement Google search into my sites.

This page uses a basic Google site search box, but a PHP script intercepts the search, grabs the term input by the user, add to it one of several randomly generated "rude" words, and then sends the new search terms off. What the users sees is results for what they typed, plus some other stuff.
